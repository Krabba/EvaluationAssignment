**QueensLab Evaluation Assignment**
**Assignment description**

**Part 1 - Map Draw**

**Develop a backend + frontend solution that allows users to draw lines on a map of Gothenburg, Sweden.**

The UI should have

- One Map (may be a 3rd party map)
- One input field with a placeholder ‘DEGREES’, that only allow numbers (degrees)
- One button ‘MOVE’
- One button ‘SAVE’
- A list of saved patterns below the map.

1) Pressing the ‘MOVE’ button should draw a 20px long line in the direction
   specified in the input field. (Pressing ‘MOVE’ again should continue drawing 
   the line from the end of the previous one)
   
2) Pressing the ‘SAVE’ button should save the pattern on the map in an
   appropriate format on the backend and display it in the list of patterns
   
3) Structure your code an add QA according to your own Definition of Done.

Keep it simple.
Try to ship as few bugs as possible. Focus on a minimal usable interface.
Functionality takes priority over design.

Allowed technologies: Angular 2+, .NET Core, Python, NodeJS, React, Vue.js,
Bootstrap, SCSS, SASS, LESS, CSS, HTML5, Vanilla JS.
